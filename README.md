# DeepVariant+GLnexus workflows

These [WDL](http://openwdl.org/) workflows use [DeepVariant](https://github.com/google/deepvariant) to call variants from WGS read alignments, followed by [GLnexus](https://github.com/dnanexus-rnd/GLnexus) to merge the resulting Genome VCF (gVCF) files for several samples into a Project VCF (pVCF).
